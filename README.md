Vehicle project code

This is a storage location for portions of code from my projects that people are interested in viewing.  
At the moment, the code documents posted here are either Arduino/C++ code excerpts from code running in an actual vehicle (the .txt files) or are full Arduino compatible files for bench testing specific components (the .ino files).  

The CANbus library used for all these code files is from here:
